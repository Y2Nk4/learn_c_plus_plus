## Learn C Plus Plus

#### 0x00 Why?

This semester, my school's class is teaching Python and JavaScript, 
which I have already been familiar with, therefore, I decided to learn 
c++ by myself in order to challenge myself. Even though I am still checking 
my professor's Python or JavaScript video on my class time, I realize the 
progress of the class is still pretty slow(I understand that's because some 
other students might haven't touched programming before. But to be honest, 
my profs' class are pretty good for the beginners, I hoped I could have 
them teach me back when I just got started.) Yea, so the progress of the 
class is slow for me, and I think getting started by myself could just 
make myself feel comfortable with the progress.

So far, it has been 3 yrs since I got into JavaScript, but to be honest,
I don't think I developed much skills on it. The robustness of my code is
still pretty bad. In these 3 yrs, I feel the advantages of JavaScript, no
doubt it's almost the best programming language for a short-term development
web-based app, or a middleware between backend service and frontend page. It's
also great for data-mining due to some features of the event-driven and massive 
amount of packages providing good support for various types of databases.

##### Why C++

While JavaScript is working well on data-mining or playing roles as middleware, 
it's not very suitable in like game-developing, embed-development, hacking or 
doing something low-level.
These days, I was doing my experiences in embed-development and game-development, 
therefore I decided to go with C++. And as you might know, Node is also written in
C++, so learning C++, might help me to understand more about JavaScript(or Node).

So, I think it's the beginning of a new journey.
